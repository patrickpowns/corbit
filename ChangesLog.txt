   Corbit Beta v1.0.29:

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: Split main file into several different files, for easier maintenance

09 June 2012
   Corbit Beta v1.0.28:

     Change log:
        -Fixed: free camera pan speeds. now operates based on a velocity basis, instead of just moving with arrow keys

07 June 2012
   Corbit Beta v1.0.27:

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: Finally gave up on trying to make a vector of smart pointers to hold ships and solarBodies, just made a single vector (entity) of dumb pointers. Not bad though.

06 June 2012
   Corbit Beta v1.0.26:

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: int main is now only 10 lines, and is therefore much simpler.

05 June 2012
   Corbit Beta v1.0.25:

     Change log:
        -Applied: boost::shared_ptrs. I still have some syntax to work out, but this will allow me to put all entities into one entity vector. Also smart pointers. Just how cool.

29 May 2012
   Corbit Beta v1.0.22:

     Change log:
        -Added: Velocity vector
        -Added: Target location

13 May 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.0128.19:

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: made extra sure all radii were in meters, as well as orbit distances

10 May 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.0119.18:

     Change log:
        -Applied: All planets are proportional yay

25 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.0111.17:

     Change log:
        -Applied: planets now stored in a vector, all iterators work properly

21 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.0104.16:

     Change log:
        -Applied: vectors, sticking with the format of one vector for ships, one for planets, because that makes sense.

11 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.099.15:

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: Virtually no memory limit in C++? EVERYTHING IS LONG DOUBLES YAY (okay, not actually, but I like long doubles)

11 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.089.14:

     Change log:
        -Typo: crafts being declared in an array of size 0. I feel sheepish. Color, weird values fixed.

09 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.078.12:

     Change log:
        -Typo: fast hab turning speed, degree/radian conversion error

09 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.073.11:

     Change log:
        -Typo: gravity arctan values calculate properly (it's y, x not x, y!)

09 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.064.10:

     Change log:
        -Added: gravity calculations

08 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.055.9:

     Change log:
        -Fixed: distances between objects not scaling with camera zoom, BEDMAS bracket error

07 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.047.8:

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: made an array of crafts and planets, used enum to label all
        -Added: collision detect on earth, will not implement incidince reflection until I have a lot of time
        -Added: arctan hab/earth calculations

06 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.044.7:

     Change log:
        -New: earth
        -Added: collision detection function
        -Added: controllable camera

04 April 2012
   Corbit Alpha v1.034.6:

     Change log:
        -Cleaned: made ship inherit from object class, neater!
