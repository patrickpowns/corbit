This is a repo to store files and source code needed to compile corbit, by Patrick Powns.

corbit is a C++ port of the QB version of orbit, perpetrated by the dmags, while involved in OCESS (spacesim.org).

corbit is a 2D flight simulator that will be used to simulate the solar system and a ship or two, and can be easily expanded.


Since this is a monopoly project for the moment, there aren't comments after every line. However, the code should be self explanatory, and there are still a decent amount of comments.
