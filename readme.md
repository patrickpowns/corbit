This is a repo to store files and source code needed to compile corbit, by Patrick Powns.

corbit is a C++ port of the QB version of orbit, perpetrated by the dmags, while involved in OCESS (spacesim.org).

corbit is a 2D flight simulator that will be used to simulate the solar system and a ship or two, and can be easily expanded.

Read the docs for more info. At the moment this is a monopoly project, but take a glance at the source and tell me what you think.
