Corbit
======

Corbit is a C++ port of the QB version of orbit, perpetrated by the dmags, while involved in OCESS (spacesim.org). This means it is a spaceflight simulator in 2D, with basic graphics, and a focus on comprehensive data readouts. It is also designed to be easily maintainable, quickly expandable, and simple to fly.

Read the docs for more info. At the moment this is a monopoly project, but take a glance at the source and tell me what you think.
